<p>Teamed up with a classmate to create a web application to help our school manage IBDP predicted grades. </p>
<p>It allows students to view their grades and set goals for future exams, while also enabling admins to view students&#39; grades, upload grades as an excel file, and manage subject grade boundaries.</p>
