<p>Working under Dr. Krishnan P. from Hofstra University, NY, I engaged in quantitative research in relation to the use of <strong>NLP</strong> (Natural Language Processing) transformers in legal scenarios. Specifically, I fine-tuned the <code>bert-large-cased</code> transformer model (334M params) to classify sentences from legal documents into different rhetorical roles.</p>
<p>The use of NLP in the legal domain will help democratize access to justice for the public by making it easier and faster for lawyers to analyze legal documents.</p>
