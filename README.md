## About me 

I'm a computer science freshman at Carnegie Mellon University. I am interested in the field of AI and ML, with some of my key interests being reasoning models and reinforcement Learning.

### My projects:

  - **Past Pilot**: An Ed-tech platform for managing academic resources like past papers, with private key-based storage and NLP integration for easy search for similar or specific questions using cosine similarity.
  
  - **Ultimate tic-tac-toe:** Minimax, AlphaZero implementation for Ultimate-tic-tac-toe along with a trained model that can be played against.

  - **legal-sentence-classification**: Fine-tuned `bert-large-cased` model (334M params) for classifying legal sentences into rhetorical roles.

  - **Flowify**: A platform for video summarization and visualization. Converts an uploaded video to an expandable and editable flowchart of different themes/topics discussed in the video.
  
  - **Lexicon Legends:** A real-time, word-based, 2 player PvP game made using NLP sentence-transformers.
  
  - **Single solution constraint solver:** Linear algebra based solver in C++ for single solution settings using matrix construction and row reduction. Step-by-step visualization included for minesweeper example.
  
  - **Autoencoder Visualizer:** A visualization of visual autoencoders. Shows input image, reconstructed image, as well as relative position and distance between images in the latent space.
