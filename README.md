# Hi there 👋
## I'm a high school student from India, and a programming enthusiast. 
### Some of my projects include...
  - Physics simulations in Python using the pygame module
  - An IBDP predicted grade calculator using the Flask web framework in python (repository: [PredictedGradeFlask](https://github.com/samkas125/PredictedGradeFlask)). Can be accessed [here](https://predictedgradetest.pythonanywhere.com).
    - Limited student data is available on this site, as it is simply a sample. 
    - Sample login for Admin:
      - UID = Admin
      - password = AdminTest
    - Sample login for Student:
      - UID = Student1
      - password = StudentTest
  - A Minecraft plugin that allows users to save, and later access locations in their worlds.
