## About me 

I'm a high school student from India and a programming enthusiast. I am intrigued by the field of AI and ML, with some of my key interests being NLP transformer models and Reinforcement Learning.

### My projects:

  - **Past Pilot**: An Ed-tech platform for managing academic resources like past papers, with private key-based storage and NLP integration for easy search for similar or specific questions using cosine similarity.
  
  - **Ultimate tic-tac-toe:** AlphaZero implementation for Ultimate-tic-tac-toe along with a trained model that can be played against.

  - **legal-sentence-classification**: Fine-tuned `bert-large-cased` model (334M params) for classifying legal sentences into rhetorical roles.
  
  - **Physics Simulations:** simulation of physical processes using the pygame module.
  
  - **Lexicon Legends:** A real-time, word-based, 2 player PvP game made using NLP sentence-transformers.
   
  - **IBDP [predicted grade management system](https://predictedgradetest.pythonanywhere.com):** Made using the Flask web framework in Python.
  
  - **Minecraft Plugin:** Java plugin that allows users to save, and later access locations in their Minecraft worlds.

### I'm currently learning:
  - NLP using HuggingFace transformers
  - Reinforcement learning design and environments
  - Convolutional Neural Networks
  - AlphaZero implementation
