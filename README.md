## About me 

I'm a high school student from India, and a programming enthusiast. I am intrigued by the field of AI and ML, with some of my key interests being NLP and Reinforcement Learning.

### My projects:

  - **Past Pilot** - An Ed-tech platform for managing academic resources like past papers, with private key-based storage and NLP integration for easy search for similar or specific questions.
  
  - **Physics simulations** in Python using the pygame module
  
  - **Ultimate tic-tac-toe** game made in Python. Allows users to play against RL agent, or another user through PyGame. (Private repo, will open soon)
  
  - **Lexicon Legend** - A word based 2 player PvP game using NLP.
   
  - **IBDP [predicted grade management](https://predictedgradetest.pythonanywhere.com)** using the Flask web framework in python.
  
  - **Minecraft plugin** that allows users to save, and later access locations in their worlds.
  
  - **Mini Games** - algorithmically generated maze, tetris, pong and snake 

### I'm currently learning:
  - NLP using HuggingFace transformers
  - Reinforcement learning design and environments
  - Convolutional Neural Networks
